/*
Inside the lib folder, we have main.dark file which is the only file responsible for the default we have on the screen right now.
In flutter, everything is a widget e.g. the floating + icon we have in the app is a widget, the two texts are wdigets and the navbar is also a widget..

The combination of these widgets is what creates your flutter app.
