/* 
We have worked with containers, columns and rows, its time to see their similarities and where they differs

1.  Container takes exactly one widget while rows and columns can take unlimited number of widgets.
2.  Container provides you with rich styling and alignment options like margin, padding, decoration (BoxDecoration for borders) etc, with rows and columns, you have alignment with main and cross axis but no styling options available.
3.  A container width is flexible, you can give it widths and heights, it can also take the width and height of its parent but columns and rows takes the full available width and not flexible.


SUMMARY
Container : - This is your go to widget for perfect custom styling and alignment, a perfect container to wrap your other widgets with in other to style them properly.
Column & Rows : - If you have more than one widgets that must sit next to each other.

TAKE AWAY : -The take away here is that you do not necessarily need to always pick one of the two but always combine them to achieve great result e.g. Wrap your column in a container or use a container inside a column or row and then you can mix and match effects..

We have more widgets but this will commonly be used and will get you very far
