/* 
The flutter widget catalog is where you have all the widgets that shipped with flutter nicely grouped into categories https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets and it is recommended to always dive into them to see how you can configure things yourself because no course can go through all the widgets available...

If you do not know the specific category a widget belongs to, you can search in the api docs https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/
