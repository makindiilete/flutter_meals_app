/*
App life cycle has to do with the behavior of our app on the phone where it is being used, we are talking about when it is being minimized, resumed or exited.. We can also tap into this moment...
#Ds life cycles getting called is not guaranteed due to some external factor e.g. Battery drained and shut down or user pull our battery..
