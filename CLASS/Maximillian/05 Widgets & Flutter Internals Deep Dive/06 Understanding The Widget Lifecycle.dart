/*
Just as we have component lifecycle in react where we have componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate etc. We also have widget lifecycle in dart... Attached are the lifecycle : -

#initState() --> ComponentDidMount of react
#didUpdateWidget --> ComponentDidUpdate of react
#dispose() --> ngOnDestroy of angular --> ds is used when u render a widget conditional and the condition is now false so its removed
