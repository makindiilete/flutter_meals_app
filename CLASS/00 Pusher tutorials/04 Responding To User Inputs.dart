In the two previous tutorials we saw that widgets are blueprints for everything that you can see (and many things that you can't see) in the user interface. Simple widgets can be combined together to make complex layouts. The majority of these layouts can be built by dividing your design into rows (use the Row widget), columns (use the Column widget), and layers (use the Stack widget).

The thing about those layouts, though, is that they were static. You could touch and tap and swipe them all day and they wouldn't do a thing. We are going to fix that in this lesson.

Today we’re going to explore how to actually do something when the user interacts with the widgets that we’ve added to our layout. The emphasis will be on simple, easy to reproduce examples. I strongly encourage you to work along as we go through each one. Make little changes to the code and see how that affects the behavior. This will greatly increase your overall learning.
