Other layout widgets
We don't have space to cover all of the layout widgets here, but you have seen the most important ones already. Here are a few others that deserve mentioning:

ListView: This widget scrolls rows or columns of content that is too big to fit on the screen. We saw this in our last lesson on widgets.
GridView: This widget scrolls content that is laid out in a grid of rows and columns.
Scaffold: This is a widget provided by the Material package. It gives an easy way to add an AppBar, FloatingActionButton, Drawer, BottomNavigationBar, SnackBar, and more. Look at your main.dart file and you'll see that we are using a Scaffold widget already.
